---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

First, using the given page, which is user virtual address, to check whether
it’s mapped in user process’s page directory(pagedir_get_page). If it’s mapped,
the frame (kernel virtual address, to be accurate) is returned.

Then if no frame is mapped to given page, we can find the corresponding
supplemental page table entry from the supplemental page table using the page
address, which is the key of supplemental hash table. Within the supplemental
page table entry, we have enum suppl_pte_type to indicate if the page is from
file, swap, or mmfile, and bool is_loaded to indicate if the page has already
been loaded into frame. If it has not been loaded yet, then we do not have a
frame for that page currently. Otherwise, it will have a corresponding frame
entry in system-wide “frame table”. If is_loaded is true, we should be able to
get it in the first step.

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

Our design employ only accessing user data through user virtual address to avoid
this issue, and we think this is best in terms of consistency. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

When we allocate frame, we use palloc_get_page. palloc_get_page uses an
exclusive lock to make sure every time only one process does
bitmap_scan_and_flip to get a free page index. Thus, only one process can access
the bitmap at a particular time. After that, the page index’s bit will be set to
in-use status. The other process has to wait for this one finish then do the
same process to get another page index, which indicates the frame.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

Before this project, all the pages of one process are all mapped in the
per-process page table, but this is not true again since we will have swap and
lazily loaded pages. So it’s reasonable to extend the page directory as a
per-process supplemental page table and using user virtual address as key of
table entry which implicitly indicate user virtual address based on the
process’s page base.

All pages that are mapped with a frame and currently in memory can be allocated
through the original page table, and the unloaded pages which include pages
haven’t loaded from file and pages have been swapped out can be found in
supplemental page table. The original page table using user virtual address to
locate the physical frame and the supplemental page table use user virtual
address to locate things on the disk.


		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

/* a system-wide frame list */
struct list vm_frames;

/* system-wide frame table entry */
struct vm_frame {
  void *frame;
  tid_t tid;
  uint32_t *pte;
  void *uva;
  struct list_elem elem;
  bool evictable;
};

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

Basically, the clock-algorithm implementation of second-chance algorithm.

Traverse the whole list of vm_frames, a pointer indicates which frame to be
replaced next, when a frame is needed, the pointer advances until it finds a
frame with a 0 accessed bit. As it advance, it clears the accessed bits. If a
frame is chosen, it will be moved to the end of frame list.

But we have exceptions. The frames that are marked false on the evict-able
attribute will be not able to be evicted. The evicting algorithms doesn’t know
why they are not evict-able.

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect the frame Q no longer has?

From frame table entry, as described above, when a frame of Q is chosen, we can know that it’s from Q and what the mapped user virtual address is. Then we will get the thread struct of Q and free the page from Q using pagedir_clear_page (). This will remove Q’s reference to the frame.

>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

We draw the line at “esp - 32”. If the fault_address is user virtual address
which 32 bytes lower than esp, it will be identified as an invalid virtual
address, otherwise the stack will be extended by one page. Because the furthest
eligible page fault is what PUSHA may cause, which is 32 bytes lower than esp. 

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

The frame table and swap table are global/system-wide, supplemental page table is per-process. 

There is an internal lock for frame table and swap table, but supplemental page
table will also might be used by other process during eviction, so to avoid
confusion and allow synchronization, we add each lock to a supplemental page
table entry. They are all internal synchronization. 

All of the locks I mentioned above are internal locks, and we provide interface
functions to offer the functionalities. then we took care of our code to make
sure each one of the three part does not interact with other parts in terms of
lock acquiring. So that we won’t have a situation like holding one lock and
acquire another lock, which means no deadlock. 

To the operations involving the global file system lock(since no internal
synchronization), we took special care of it by wrapping it in a function only
involving file system operation, analyzing the logic and make sure there won’t
be two or more processes holding difference locks and trying to acquire each
other's lock.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify

>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

We use a lock for each suppl page table entry. Accessing to a particular page
entry requires acquiring the lock first. 

During eviction, the first thing is to acquire the lock and clear the page, so
that when Q tries to access it, it will get a page fault and try to look up the
supplemental page table entry, then it will be held at acquiring the lock
procedure until the eviction finished.

>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q

There is an evictable attribute in each frame table entry, which will be set to
false before reading from file system or swap. The algorithm will recognize the
attribute and prevent it from being evicted. 

Given the algorithm we use and the “new”(which P is trying to read data to)
frame will be pushed back to the the end of the list, it’s unlikely to choose
the frame again. 

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur

The pages are checked before get into the real functionality of the system call,
if it’s in paged out, it will be brought back. Then the corresponding frames to
the pages are set evict-able flag to false in frame table. When the evicting
process see the flag, it will get pass the frame without considering to evict
it. 

To invalid addresses, they will be pre-checked and detected in the same
procedure of checking page out pages, then rejected. And also the mechanism to
determine an invalid access in page fault, like the access to the address
represented by “main” function. If detected, the process will be forced to exit.

First of all, we don’t want a lock for whole VM system, it greatly limit the
parallelism of the system, which is the last thing we want to see. So we
introduce a separate lock for each global resource, like frame table, and we try
to make it internal to avoid deadlock happens which are enlightened by the
design document. We intended to add a lock for each per-process supplemental
page table. But the question B6 in Design Document got us. We thought of several
things like turn off the interrupt for a while, they all turned out to have
flaws, until the idea that we can let it fail and handle it in page fault, so
that if we give a lock for each entry will be enough to reach atomic for each
frame. However, we are concerning about that there will be too much locks. We
analyzed it carefully, looks like no deadlock will happen and this is the only
solution we got, so we go with it. 


			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct mmfile
{
  mapid_t mapid;
  struct file* file;
  void * start_addr;
  unsigned pg_cnt; 
  struct hash_elem elem;
};

The memory mapped file structure needs to keep map ID, mapped file, start
address in memory, and page count.

struct thread 
{
    …....
#ifdef USERPROG
    …...
    /* Memory Maped Files table */
    mapid_t mapid_allocator;
    struct hash mmfiles;
#endif
    …....
}

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

For each process, it keeps a hash table of memory mapped files. When starting a
process, it will initialize the hash table. The mmap and munmap are through
system calls. mmap will load file into memory and get a mapid. munmap will free
the memory and check if the corresponding pages are dirty, if they are dirty,
the page content needs to write back to the file, otherwise, just free the
pages. When a process exits, it will free all its memory mapped files.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

Before doing map, we get the file length and calculate how many pages it
needs. Suppose it needs n pages. Given the user virtual address uvaddr, we check
if any of uvaddr, uvaddr + PGSIZE, …, uvaddr + PGSIZE * (n - 1) have been mapped
to any frames. Since we have two page tables -- the page tables Pintos
originally has and the supplemental page table we implemented, we need to check
if there is any entries in either of them. If any of these user virtual address
has been an entry of the two page tables, then return -1.

We used a different data structure at the first place, but after we found out
the similarity of the two process and determined that the semantics are both
based on files, we did some abstraction to make then share the data structure,
which is the data in suppl_pte_data in supplemental page table. Based on the
share data structure, they share as much of the code as possible in our
implementation. Where we believe the sharing won’t make any confusion based on
semantic and sharing codes reduces redundancy.
